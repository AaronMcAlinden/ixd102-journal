                <h1>Friday 25th September Lecture</h1>
                <h2>Introduction and Reverse History</h2>
            </header>
            <p>During this week's lecture we recieved a brief overview of the history of design and learned the importance of having a broad knowledge of art and design history.</p>
            <p>We viewed the works of prominent designers such as:</p>
            <h3>
                <a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/dieter-rams">Dieter Rams</a>
                </h3>
            <img src="images/Dieter-Rams.jpg" alt="Image of Dieter Rams" title="Dieter Rams"width="395" height="330"/>
            
            
            <p>Rams was a prominent German born designer who studied at the Ulm School of Design and is famous for his minimalistic, modernist product design
            </p>
            <p>Rams had a signifiant influence on:</p>
            <h3>
                <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/pr/bios/jonathan-ive.html">Jonanthan Ive</a>
            </h3>
            <img src="images/Jony-Ive.jpg" alt="Image of Jonathan Ive" title="Jony Ive" width="330" height="377"/>
            
            <p>Jony Ive is an english born product designer who designed many of apple's famous products, such as the iMac and iPod. Ive was heavily influenced by the work of Dieter Rams, this influence became visible in many of Ive's design concepts including the design of many of the products we use today.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Art history has had a profound effect on the world of Design. Without a knowledge of the history art and design many of the products we use and rely on today may not be as we now know them and perhaps may never have come to be. It is important that as designers we have a good understanding of art and design history so we can better understand and influence the design's of the future.</p>
